## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to predict **daily rainfall probability** based on historical weather data using **machine learning models**. The dataset includes weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and pressure. The final model predicts whether it will rain on a given day, helping businesses and individuals make data-driven decisions.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes trends and correlations.  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trains multiple models and selects the best one.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses GridSearchCV for optimization.  
- **Real-time Predictions**: Designed for API integration with IoT sensor data.
